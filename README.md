# Rossman Prediction Sales

## About this project

In this project, the CFO summoned all store managers to deliver the sales forecast for up to six weeks advance.

So, many of these managers contacted me for consult the data to make the prediction for their stores. So, I went looking for the real stakeholder to understand the main reason for this sales forecast. When talking to managers, I was told that was a request from the CFO at a meeting with all managers.

When discussing with the CFO, he informs me that wants to know the store sales forecast because wants to renovate them, and he would like to know how much money will have in cash to carry out the construction. So, i understand the root cause and start looking for the data that will help me make this prediction.

As this is a problem originating from a Kaggle competition, the data was made available through the platform, and it is not necessary to use extraction from databases and other sources.

**Motivation:** The CFO requested this solution during a monthly results meeting.

**Main problem:** Investment in store renovation

**Stakeholder:** CFO

**Solution Format:** Daily sales for the next 6 weeks, prediction problem, time series, mobile delivery (Telegram).
